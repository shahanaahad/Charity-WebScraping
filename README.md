# Charity-WebScraping
This is my first attempt at web scraping. I tried to scrape the details of the funding organisations. I need to figure out a way to save this as a text file.
Furthermore, it would be great if I could figure out how to export it as a CSV file. However, I dont know how to create different titles and im finding it 
difficult to understand the HTML code.
